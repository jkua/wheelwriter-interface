# Wheelwriter Interface Board

There are two versions of the Wheelwriter Interface Board. v1 is the original 
prototype and was wired up on a solderless breadboard. This is what the code 
base was developed on as of 2024-08-19. This design is based on 
[tofergregg's](https://github.com/tofergregg/IBM-Wheelwriter-Hack) work.


v2 was designed to be a fabricated PCB and be the same size as the original 
Wheelwriter expansion boards, fit in the original expansion housing, and 
connect to the Wheelwriter expansion interface connector. This design has 
and isolated power supply and bus interface and is powered by the typewriter 
instead of the Arduino's USB port. As of 2024-08-19, this v2 design has been 
fabbed but not assembled.
